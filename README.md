# Dreambooth on Modal

Running [Dreambooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242)
training to customize Stable Diffusion using
[Modal](https://modal.com/),
a new cloud-native development tool for ML.

The
[Dreambooth training script](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth)
is from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/dreambooth).

This is a very rough draft.

You'll need accounts on Hugging Face, W&B, and Modal
in order to run this code.
